Hello thanks for looking at my repo!


This project started when I downloadeded firefox and was shocked by the words it wanted to autocorrect into.  So I am happy to say I have made some changes.

The project is small and in python, it will read the file line by line and match that line vs the filter database then delete.  You can add any words you want removed in filter.txt just after each word use the format: one, two, three, four

As for what I did remove.... I dont remember ;)



You will need to edit the file locally then replace in the standard firefox location.
